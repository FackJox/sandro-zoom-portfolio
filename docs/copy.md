## 1. Hero / Immediate Hook

**On-screen copy (exact words):**

- `sandrogh`
    
- `HIGH ALTITUDE & HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT`
    
- `Over the past decade I’ve documented some of the biggest stories from the world of high altitude mountaineering.`
    
- `With feeling and fortitude I have the experience to bring human stories from the world’s most inhumane corners.`
    

**Notes (not part of copy):**

- Big, cinematic hero: mountain footage / still, minimal text.
    
- First scroll reveals the client logos as a proof band.

## 2. Social Proof Strip (Client Logos)

**On-screen copy:**

- `Berghause Client`
    
- `Osprey Client`
    
- `RedBull TV Client`
    
- `EPIC TV Client`
    
- `Netflix Client`
    
- `BBC Client`
    
- `The North Face Client`
    
- `Black Crows Client`
    
- `FP Client`
    
- `Scarpa Client`
    

**Notes:**

- Horizontal scrolling / marquee band under the hero.
    
- This is the “this is legit” moment before the story dives in.

## 3. Big Film Story: 14 Peaks + K2

**Section label using existing heading:**

- `FILM`
    

**On-screen copy (chunked into cards/chapters):**

**Card 1 – Netflix / 14 Peaks**

- `I worked as lead cinematographer on Netflix's smash hit 14 Peaks. I shot most of the drone footage along with key scenes including the intro, Nims visiting his family and the K2 drama.`
    

**Card 2 – K2 Winter Expedition**

- `I then worked as DOP on the first successful K2 winter expedition.`
    

**Card 3 – K2 Summit Visual Anchor**

- `K2 SUMMIT 2022`
    
- `Sunset on K2 winter, 2020 (1).jpg`
    

**Notes:**

- Treat each “card” as a scroll step: first the 14 Peaks drone work, then K2 winter, then the K2 summit still.

## 4. Film Stories: Sasha / Grace / Noshaq

Still under **FILM**, but broken into separate scrollytelling beats:

**Card 4 – Sasha / No Days Off**

- `In 2022 I filmed episode 1 of Sasha DiGiulian's 'No Days Off'`
    
- `series for RedBull TV. During preparation for Petzl's RocTrip Sasha, Alex Megos, Steve McClure & Neil Gresham developed new routes in a remote and undeveloped corner of Greece's mainland.`
    
- `sasha film thumbnail`
    

**Card 5 – Grace / Mental Health**

- `I directed, shot and edited the story of Grace, a recovering climber searching for a bigger life. Focusing on mental health and community the film was supported by Montane and played at film festivals world wide.`
    

**Card 6 – Afghanistan / Charles Schwab**

- `Filmed during one of six trips to Afghanistan this commercial for Charles Schwab bank depicts preparation for our record breaking expedition to Mt Noshaq, the countries highest peak at 7,495m.`
    

**Notes:**

- Each project is one scrollytelling “chapter” with its own still/video and short block of text.
    
- You might order them as: Netflix → K2 → Sasha → Grace → Afghanistan to escalate from well-known to deeply personal.

## 5. Photo + Climbing Credibility

**Section label:**

- `PHOTO`
    

**On-screen copy (structured as two panels):**

**Panel 1 – Successful climbs**

- `SUCCESSFUL CLIMBS`
    
- `8000M EVEREST x 2, K2, MANASLU`
    
- `7000M MT NOSHAQ`
    
- `6000M AMA DABLAM, KYAJO RI, ACONCAGUA, CHIMBORAZO`
    
- `5000M El ALTAR, CAYAMBE, LOBUCHE, LURI PEAK`
    

**Panel 2 – Unsuccessful climbs**

- `UNSUCCESSFUL CLIMBS`
    
- `8000M EVEREST, DHAULAGIRI, K2 WINTER, CHO OYU (NEPAL)`
    
- `5000M MT LOGAN, KOH E PAMIR`
    

**Background visual:**

- `basecamp drone darker_edited_edited.jpg`
    

**Notes:**

- Turn this into a vertical “stat reveal” section: one scroll for successful climbs, next for unsuccessful.
    
- The “unsuccessful climbs” panel is really strong story-wise; it humanises him.

## 6. About Me – Turned into Three Story Beats

Use the heading:

- `ABOUT ME`
    

### Beat 1 – Front-line perspective

**On-screen copy:**

- `Over the past decade I’ve documented some of the biggest stories from the world of high altitude mountaineering. I stood on the highest peak in Afghanistan, Mt Noshaq as the first Afghan woman summited and the highest peak in Pakistan, K2 as the first Pakistani woman summited. I filmed Nirmal Purja as he set a blazing speed record on the 14 8,000ers and filmed Kristin Harila as she smashed it.`
    

_(You already used the first sentence in the hero; that’s fine in scrollytelling—treat this as a “restate with more detail” moment.)_

### Beat 2 – Origin story (City → Army → Mountains)

**On-screen copy (split into tighter paragraphs):**

- `A winding path brought me to the mountains. After dropping out of uni I spent 3 years in Birmingham filming raves, music videos and weddings.`
    
- `Wanting to see more of the world I joined the British army reserve and soon the commando training combined with my passion for story telling provided opportunities to do just that.`
    
- `I filmed army expeds to Dhaulagiri in 2016 and Everest in 2017, began building a basecamp network and haven’t really stopped carrying cameras up mountains since.`
    

### Beat 3 – Values + Ongoing Work

**On-screen copy:**

- `With feeling and fortitude I have the experience to bring human stories from the world’s most inhumane corners. I believe deeply in representation and hope the projects I’ve worked on show people what’s possible when you look up and believe.`
    
- `Stories from the mountains and the people in between`
    
- `are slowly being collected on my Youtube channel.`
    

**Notes:**

- The line break in “Stories from the mountains and the people in between / are slowly being collected…” works nicely as a subtle motion moment (first line fades in, second slides up).

- `AERIAL CINEMATOGRAPHY`
